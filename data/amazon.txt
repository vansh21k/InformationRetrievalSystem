Amazon.com, Inc. /ˈæməzɒn/ is an American international electronic commerce company with headquarters in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is the world's largest online retailer.[9][10][11] Amazon.com started as an online bookstore, but soon diversified, selling DVDs, VHSs, CDs, video and MP3 downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. The company also produces consumer electronics—notably the Amazon Kindle e-book reader and the Kindle Fire tablet computer—and is a major provider of cloud computing services.

Jeff Bezos incorporated the company (as Cadabra) in July 1994 and the site went online as Amazon.com in 1995.[12] The company was renamed after the Amazon River, one of the largest rivers in the world,[12] which in turn was named after the Amazons, the legendary nation of female warriors in Greek mythology.

Amazon has separate retail websites for United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, India and Mexico, with international shipping to certain other countries for some of its products.[13] In 2011, it had professed an intention to launch its websites in Poland,[14] Netherlands, and Sweden, as well.[15] An Austrian website operates as part of the German website.
