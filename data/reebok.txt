The name comes from the Afrikaans spelling of rhebok, a type of African antelope or gazelle. In 1890 in Holcombe Brook, a small village six miles north east of Bolton, Joseph William Foster was producing and selling regular running shoes when he came up with the idea to create a novelty spiked running shoe. After his ideas progressed, he joined with his sons and founded a shoe company named J.W. Foster and Sons in 1895.[6]

In 1958, two of the founder's grandsons Joe and Jeff Foster renamed the company "Reebok" in the United Kingdom, having found the name in a dictionary won in a running race by Joe Foster as a boy; the dictionary was a South African edition, hence the spelling.[7] The company lived up to the J.W. Foster legacy, manufacturing first-class footwear for customers throughout the UK. In 1979, Paul Fireman, an American sporting goods distributor, saw a pair of Reeboks at an international trade show and negotiated to sell them in the U.S.[6]
